## Last Week's Accomplishments

Went through the Github repo to find the most recent functional version of the program.

## This Week's Plan

Make the presentation slides and make a new website for this app.

## Anything Blocking?

The working version of our frontend is missing from the repository and it's probably stored locally by the previous member of the team.
Based on some of the file path in the code, it seems that the test images are stored locally as well.
