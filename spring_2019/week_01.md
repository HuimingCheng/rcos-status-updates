## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I talked with the old members of the team and started reading the existing code on nmachine learning and 
database.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to keep reading and hopefully get a better understanding of what the program is capable of doing now

## Anything Blocking?

Some of the handwriting recognition problems may not be solvable this semester since I'm not sure if I'll be able to improve the current algorithm or model.
