## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent the last week reading the existing code.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to keep reading the code about machine learning and see how wells it functions.

## Anything Blocking?

Some of the handwriting recognition problems may not be solvable this semester since I'm not sure if I'll be able to improve the current algorithm or model.

## Notes
