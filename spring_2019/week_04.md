## Last Week's Accomplishments

Tried different sample codes found online to read the sample handwriting, didn't have much improvement.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to change the structure of the database to allow for a more personalized storage for the users.

## Anything Blocking?

Some of the original data are not stored on Github so I might need to start from scratch and create a brand new database with flask.
