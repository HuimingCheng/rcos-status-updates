## Last Week's Accomplishments

I talked to Prof. Turner and got some suggestions about using the thinning algorithm for handwriting recognition.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to run the recognition function on more samples and see what's causing the errors.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing for now.

## Notes
Had bunch of assignments due for other classes so the progress might be slow for RCOS.
