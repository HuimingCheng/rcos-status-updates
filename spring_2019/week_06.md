## Last Week's Accomplishments

Drew several basic entity-relationship diagram for our database.

## This Week's Plan

Learn how to use firebase.

## Anything Blocking?

We are pretty close to the deliver deadline for SD&D and there's a project due for Operating System so we might not have a lot of time to 
code.

## Notes

We're using firebase for SD&D as well so I can just try to understand how our website accesses firebase and iterate through all the table
(for firebase the structure is more like a dictionary with several layers) and acquires the data.
